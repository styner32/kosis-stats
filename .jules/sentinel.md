## 2024-05-18 - [Overly Permissive CORS Configuration]
**Vulnerability:** The API allowed `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` while simultaneously setting `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. This combination is a security risk as it allows any origin to make authenticated cross-origin requests using the user's credentials, potentially exposing sensitive data.
**Learning:** Hardcoding `*` for allowed origins alongside credentials allows for CSRF-like attacks where a malicious site can read responses using a user's session.
**Prevention:** Implement a dynamic origin validation mechanism that checks incoming origins against an explicit, configurable allowlist before setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` headers.
